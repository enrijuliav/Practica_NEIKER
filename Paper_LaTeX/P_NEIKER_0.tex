\section{Introduction}

In 2024 about 523.8 million metric tons of rice were consumed worldwide. Besides, over 50 percent of the world population depends on rice for about 80 percent of its food requirements. To meet this demand a total of 200 million km$^2$ are destined to cultivating rice in paddy fields, which is more than 10\% of the world cropland.
